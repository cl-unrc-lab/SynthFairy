# SynthFairy
A tool for synthesis of controller strategies against fair adversaries.

This is the source code and binaries distribution of the SynthFairy Tool,

Compile:
$ ant compile jar

Clean:
$ ant clean

Run:
$ ./bin/synthFairy <options> <model path>. 

Options:
    -d : create dot file
    -v : turn verbosity on
    p=<num> : use precision <num> for real numbers
    b=<num> : set upper bound for value iteration

Examples can be found
in the tests directory.

To generate all tests and replicate all experimental results shown on paper "Controller Synthesis in Stochastic Games with Fair Adversaries" (Castro, Dâ€™Argenio, Demasi, Putruele), run the /bin/test script.
